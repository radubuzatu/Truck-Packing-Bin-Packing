# Truck-Packing-Bin-Packing
This repository contains the binary linear programming (BLP) implementations of Truck Packing Problem (TPP) which is a variation of Bin Packing Problem. 

The TPP optimizes the placing of rolls within the trucks so that the specific load is maximum and all rolls are distributed among the trucks. 
The <\it specific load> is the ratio of the total weight of all rolls to the maximum allowable load of all used trucks.
